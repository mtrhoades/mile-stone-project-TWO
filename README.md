# mile-stone-project-TWO

This project was a collaboration of myself and two other team members.

I was the team lead on this project and designed the entire back-end with some of the UX/UI for front end as well.

This project is a simple crypto watch list. It started out for just stocks and I quickly changed it to just crypto although it could easily have both. 

It is a table with a search bar that is connected to a crypto currency API from coingecko.com and you can add, edit, delete coins to your watchlist table with the live price data pulled from the API.

Technologies used:
    Node.js
    Express.js
    SQL/postgresql
    ReactJS
